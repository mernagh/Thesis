## Cycling behaviour and exposure modelling using bike tracking data

This is a project completed by Thomas Mernagh, in collaboration with SM Labib at Utrecht University, for partial fulfillment of the award of Master of Science in Applied Data Science.

### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my supervisor SM Labib for his continued support over the course of this research project, without our discussions and his insights, I would not have been able to reach my potential for this work. I would also like to thank my family and friends back in Ireland who offered continued support for my new chapter in life here in the Netherlands.

### Abstract
This project aims to research the built micro-environment of Utrecht province and investigate which characteristics of urban routes influence the route choices of individuals. To answer this question, multiple open-source datasets and a citizen science project’s data were synthesised. Different points of interest (POIs) were created using GIS methods and finally different statistical and machine learning techniques were applied to understand the possible relationships. Our results showed that there was a positive statistically significant relationship to the built environment and the choice of a citizen in the use of the active transport mode of cycling. In particular, distance to Points of Interest (POIs), slope of area and the greenness of a route (measured using NDVI calculations). While insightful, the major limitation of the current study, it must be noted that the results show high variance due to the choice of using only a sample set to help with computational power. Due to these limitations, the results should be interpreted with caution and considered as only a preliminary exploration.  This study extended on the idea that conditions affect the choice model and shows the built environment is relevant in choice of people. Future work should explore whether the established relationships hold for larger populations, and whether an activity space typology can be derived and related to socioeconomic demographics. In addition, future work could explore which representation of an activity space “better” explains the differences between different groups, or gives the best representation of activity-travel behaviour in general. Factors such as noise pollution and number of traffic accidents would be a welcome addition to the model for future studies. 
The inclusion of trip purpose and travel mode information, for instance, could also improve the representations as the suitability of a representation may vary with its purpose. We conclude that built environment factors do in fact influence route choice.
